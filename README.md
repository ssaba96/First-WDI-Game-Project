# First-WDI-Game-Project

For my first project, i had to build a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery library used). This game is not a remake of existing game, however it has been inspired by Simon says games with a creepy flavour. It expects the player to follow the same pattern as generated by the computer to gain points to win.

###### STEP 1: The player clicks start. The computer then changes 3 image of random cells.

###### Step 2: The player then clicks the same cells in same order. Bats appearing indicates the cells player has clicked. If player gets the order correct, 1 point is added to the score.

This game can be made more challenging by adding levels to it and increase number of cells picked by computer after Players each win.
