# First-WDI-Game-Project : Follow Me

### Overview

The user has to remember and click cards in the order they were flashed to gain points and win.

For my first project, i had to build a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery library used). This game is not a remake of existing game, however it has been inspired by Simon says games with a creepy flavour. It expects the player to follow the same pattern as generated by the computer to gain points to win.

### Project Brief

Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between two players
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

This game can be made more challenging by adding levels to it and increase number of cells picked by computer after Players' each win.
