# Project-1 WDI-Game : Follow Me

### Overview

This game comes with bit of a creepy flavour. To gain points and win, the user has to remember and click cards in the order they were flashed.

### Project Brief

Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between two players
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

###### Step 2: The player then clicks the same cells in same order. Bats appearing indicates the cells player has clicked. If player gets the order correct, 1 point is added to the score.

### Challenges and Problems

- It was challenging to generate a random flashing sequence by the computer.

- It took more time than expected to replace 'You Won' with 'Game Over' if user did not click all images flashed in correct order.

---

### Wins

- I figured out the loop to add one point to the score if user clicked all images flashed in correct order.


- I was able to add reset functionality to the game when 'Play Again' is clicked.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- The level of this game can be made difficult by adding levels to it and increase number of cells picked by computer after Players' each win.

- This can be made into a two player game to make it more challenging.
