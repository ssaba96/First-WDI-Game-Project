How the Memory Game works?
Player1 clicks start. Cards flash/show in random order one by one and user needs to remember the order and click on all card in same order. If a mistake is made by Player 1 by clicking in wrong order, Player2 gets the next turn. 1 point gets added to the player who gets order right.
